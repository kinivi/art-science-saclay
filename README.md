## Web interface
üö© You need key to access GPT-3 by OpenAI. Check [this website](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/)

Install requirements:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Add the key: 

`export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`

Run Flask back-end: 

`python3 web.py -p apple`  

## Hardware
Our idead is that instead of keyaboard we used touches. Special conductive paint was painted onto apple and connected to the Arduino. Each point corresponds to the topics of question. Touch triggers serial port message which listened for at Web UI. That triggers question to chatbot and display the responce.
